# Agent Authentication Tokens
# ==========================
#
# SECURITY WARNING: This file contains sensitive authentication tokens.
# Ensure proper file permissions: chmod 600 tokens.yaml
#
# Each service deployed as an agent needs a token to authenticate
# with the Overwatch node. Tokens should be:
# - At least 32 characters
# - Unique per service
# - Generated securely (e.g., openssl rand -base64 32)
#
# To add a new service:
# 1. Generate a token: openssl rand -base64 32
# 2. Add it here: service_name: "generated-token"
# 3. Configure the agent with the same token
# 4. Send SIGHUP to Overwatch to reload: kill -HUP $(pidof opengslb)
