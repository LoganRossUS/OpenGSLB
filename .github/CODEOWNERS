# OpenGSLB Code Owners
# This file defines individuals responsible for code in this repository.
# 
# GitHub uses this file to automatically request reviews from code owners
# when pull requests are created that modify their code.
#
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes precedence.
#
